# Mouse Targeting System

## Overview
The application now features an intelligent mouse targeting system that automatically moves the mouse to the center of detected human body parts based on a configurable priority ranking system. The system includes coordinate scaling to ensure accurate targeting.

## Priority Ranking System

### Body Part Priority (Highest to Lowest)
1. **Head** (Priority 1) - Highest priority target
2. **Face** (Priority 2) - Second highest priority
3. **Torso** (Priority 3) - Body center
4. **Body** (Priority 4) - Full body outline
5. **Left Leg** (Priority 5) - Left leg region
6. **Right Leg** (Priority 5) - Right leg region
7. **Left Arm** (Priority 6) - Left arm region
8. **Right Arm** (Priority 6) - Right arm region
9. **Left Hand** (Priority 7) - Left hand
10. **Right Hand** (Priority 7) - Right hand
11. **Left Foot** (Priority 8) - Left foot
12. **Right Foot** (Priority 8) - Right foot
13. **Person** (Priority 9) - Full person (lowest priority)

### Targeting Logic

The mouse targeting system now respects your body part selection:

```python
# Mouse only considers detections from selected body parts
if label in self.body_part_priority and self.body_part_priority[label] < 999:
    # Among selected parts, target highest confidence
    if confidence > best_confidence and confidence > confidence_threshold:
        best_target = detection
```

**Key Features:**
- **User Selection**: Only targets body parts you've checked
- **Confidence Based**: Among selected parts, targets highest confidence
- **Real-time**: Changes apply immediately when checkboxes change
- **No Fixed Priority**: No hardcoded priority system

## Key Features

### Center Targeting
- Mouse moves to the exact center of detected bounding boxes
- Calculated as: `center_x = x + width // 2`, `center_y = y + height // 2`
- Ensures precise targeting regardless of bounding box size

### Confidence Filtering
- Only targets detections above the confidence threshold
- Configurable threshold (30-90%)
- Prevents targeting low-confidence detections

### Smooth Movement
- Natural mouse movement with configurable smoothing
- Smoothing factor: 10-90% (higher = smoother)
- Prevents jerky mouse movements

### Debug Mode
- Console output shows targeting information
- Displays: target body part, coordinates, confidence
- Helps understand targeting decisions

### Coordinate Scaling
- **NEW: Fixed Coordinate Scaling** - The system now properly scales coordinates from the processed detection frame to the original screen coordinates, ensuring the mouse points to the exact center of bounding boxes.
- **Automatic Scaling**: Coordinates are automatically scaled from processed frame to screen
- **Performance Optimized**: Detection runs on smaller frames for better performance
- **Accurate Targeting**: Mouse points to actual center of bounding boxes
- **Debug Information**: Shows scaling factors and coordinate conversion

        # Priority ranking dictionary
        self.body_part_priority = {
            'head': 1, 'face': 2, 'torso': 3, 'body': 4,
            'left_leg': 5, 'right_leg': 5, 'left_arm': 6, 'right_arm': 6,
            'left_hand': 7, 'right_hand': 7, 'left_foot': 8, 'right_foot': 8,
            'person': 9
        }
    
    def _move_to_target(self):
        # Find best target based on priority and confidence
        # Move mouse to center of bounding box
        # Apply smoothing for natural movement
```

### Targeting Algorithm
1. **Filter detections** by confidence threshold
2. **Calculate priority** for each detection
3. **Select best target** (lowest priority number, highest confidence)
4. **Calculate center** of bounding box
5. **Apply smoothing** to mouse movement
6. **Move mouse** to target position

### Performance Considerations
- **60 FPS targeting**: Updates 60 times per second
- **Smooth movement**: Prevents jerky mouse behavior
- **Confidence filtering**: Reduces false positives
- **Priority caching**: Efficient priority lookups

## Troubleshooting

### Mouse Not Targeting Center

## Technical Details

### Coordinate Scaling

The system handles frame resizing for performance while maintaining accurate targeting:

```python
# Calculate center in processed frame coordinates
center_x = x + w // 2
center_y = y + h // 2

# Scale to original screen coordinates
screen_x = int(center_x * scale_factor_x)
screen_y = int(center_y * scale_factor_y)
```

### Priority Logic

```python
# Priority: 1. Higher priority (lower number), 2. Higher confidence
if (priority < best_priority or 
    (priority == best_priority and confidence > best_confidence)):
    if confidence > confidence_threshold:
        best_target = detection
```

### Smoothing Algorithm

```python
# Apply smoothing for natural movement
smooth_x = int(last_x * (1 - smoothing_factor) + target_x * smoothing_factor)
smooth_y = int(last_y * (1 - smoothing_factor) + target_y * smoothing_factor)
```

## Testing

### Test Scripts

Run the test scripts to verify functionality:

```bash
# Test coordinate scaling

- Check "Head" checkbox
- Uncheck all other body parts
- **Result**: Only head bounding boxes, no full person boxes
- **Use case**: Precise head tracking for targeting

#### Option B: Detect Person Only
- Check "Person" checkbox
- Uncheck all body parts (head, face, torso, etc.)
- **Result**: Only full person bounding boxes
- **Use case**: General person presence detection

#### Option C: Detect Person + Specific Body Parts
- Check "Person" checkbox
- Check "Head" and "Face" checkboxes
- **Result**: Both person boxes and head/face boxes
- **Use case**: Both general and precise detection

#### Option D: Detect Only Body Parts (No Person)
- Uncheck "Person" checkbox
- Check "Head", "Face", "Torso" checkboxes
- **Result**: Only body part boxes, no full person boxes
- **Use case**: Specific body part tracking without person clutter

### Detection Modes

1. **All Body Parts**: Detects everything (person + all body parts)
2. **Person Only**: Detects only full person
3. **Custom Selection**: Choose exactly what to detect

### Benefits

- **More precise control** over what gets detected
- **Avoid visual clutter** from unwanted detections
- **Optimize performance** by detecting only what you need
- **Better targeting accuracy** for specific use cases
- **Flexible detection strategies** for different scenarios

## Multi-Monitor Support

The targeting system correctly handles multi-monitor setups by:

1. **Monitor offset calculation**: Uses monitor information from the screen capture system
2. **Absolute coordinate conversion**: Converts relative coordinates to absolute screen coordinates
3. **Coordinate scaling**: Handles frame resizing for performance optimization

### Coordinate Calculation Process

1. **Detection coordinates**: YOLO provides coordinates in the processed frame (e.g., 640x480)
2. **Scale to original**: Convert to original monitor resolution using scaling factors
3. **Add monitor offset**: Add the monitor's position in the global screen coordinate system
4. **Apply smoothing**: Use exponential smoothing for natural movement
5. **Move mouse**: Use pyautogui to move to the calculated absolute coordinates

Example for a secondary monitor:
```
Processed frame: (320, 240)  # Center of 640x480
Scaled to monitor: (900, 584)  # Scaled to monitor resolution
Monitor offset: (3008, 991)   # Monitor position in global coordinates
Absolute screen: (3908, 1575) # Final mouse position
```

## Debug Output

When debug mode is enabled, the system provides detailed information:

```
üéØ Targeting head at (1504, 846) confidence: 0.85
üéØ Processed coords: (320, 240) -> Screen coords: (1504, 846)
üéØ Monitor offset: (0, 0)
üéØ Absolute coords: (1504, 846)
üéØ Movement: duration=0.045s, distance=125.3px
üìè Scaling factors: X=4.70, Y=3.52
üìè Original: (3008, 1692), Processed: (640, 480)
```

## Performance Considerations

- **Frame resizing**: Large frames are resized to 1280px width for performance
- **Coordinate caching**: Scaling factors are cached to avoid recalculation
- **Smooth movement**: Movement duration is calculated based on distance
- **Thread safety**: Mouse control runs in a separate thread to prevent GUI freezing

## Future Enhancements
